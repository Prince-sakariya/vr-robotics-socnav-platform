## Social Navigation Cost Functions

The literature reveals several common cost functions used in socially aware navigation:

### 1. Distance-Based Cost Functions
- **Minimum Distance Cost**: Penalizes paths that bring the robot too close to humans [16]
- **Proxemic Cost**: Assigns different weights to personal, social, and public spaces [17, 18]
- **Anisotropic Cost**: Considers direction-dependent personal space (larger in front than sides) [19]

### 2. Trajectory-Based Cost Functions
- **Trajectory Intersection Cost**: Penalizes paths that cross predicted human trajectories [20]
- **Velocity Matching Cost**: Encourages the robot to match speed and direction of human flow [21]
- **Time-to-Collision Cost**: Considers not just distance but time until potential collision [22]

### 3. Social Norm Cost Functions
- **Passing Side Cost**: Encourages culturally appropriate passing behavior (e.g., right side) [23]
- **Group Disturbance Cost**: Penalizes breaking up conversational groups [24, 25]
- **Interaction Space Cost**: Avoids interrupting face-to-face interactions [26]

### 4. Human Comfort Cost Functions
- **Visibility Cost**: Penalizes approaches from outside the human's field of view [27]
- **Acceleration Cost**: Limits sudden robot movements that might startle humans [28]
- **Predictability Cost**: Encourages robot behavior that humans can easily anticipate [29, 30]
